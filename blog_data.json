        "body": "<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">If you’re reading this post, chances are you are planning on hiring a </span><a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/dubai-professional-home-cleaning\"><i><strong>home cleaning service company</strong></i></a><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">, but maybe are a little unsure about how often you need one. Some of you may still be wondering if you need one at all! We understand your confusions, and after years of being in the business, we can safely say that many of our customers have the same questions. And so, we’ve put together a list of questions we feel customers should ask themselves before hiring a pro house cleaning company from Corecare.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>#1. How big is your house?</strong></h3><p>The best things about small houses is that are very easy to maintain and keep tidy. Studio apartments, and single bedroom apartments don’t need a thorough home cleaning service more than once every two weeks. In comparison, a bigger house with more number of rooms could a use a professional home cleaning services more regularly; every week to be exact. Of course, this also depends on your lifestyle and preferences.</p><h3><strong>#2. Do you have children or pets?</strong></h3><p>If there are toddlers and young children (this includes pets too!) in your family, your house is sure to get messy, soon after a complete scrubdown! In this case, it is a good idea to get hire professional home cleaning services every week, for a thorough cleansing and sanitisation of your home.If yours is a simple two-member family, with no children of any kind, you could schedule a complete home cleaning service every fortnight. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>#3. What is your budget?</strong></h3><p>Financial plans determine many of our choices – including how often should one hire professional home cleaning services in Dubai, or even whether we want to hire one at all! In case saving up is at the top of your agenda right now, you could do most of the tidying yourself, and hire home cleaning services every 20 – 30 days.</p><p>Having said that, UrbanClap does provide home cleaning services at affordable rates. So instead of wasting your time cleaning up, you could let professionals look after your house, while you use the time more productively.</p><h3><strong>#4. What’s your lifestyle like?</strong></h3><p>Your lifestyle too determines how often you need to hire a professional home cleaning service. If you’re someone who travels for work, and are barely at home, you don’t need to give your home a professional cleaning that often. However, if you work a regular 9 to 5 job and live with a family, you might want to book professional cleaning services more often. Interestingly, busy executives as well as stay-home moms, both need a extra pair of professional hands to look after cleaning, so hiring professional home cleaning services is an obvious decision for them.</p><h3><strong>#5. Anything special coming up?</strong></h3><p>Do you have a dinner party planned for the weekend? Are your parents visiting you soon? In special instances hiring a professional cleaning home service to thoroughly clean out every corner of the house is your best bet to make a good impression on the visitors – especially on your parents!</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

And this despite kitchen being the busiest or most used spaces in our homes! Ironic, right?</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Well, we don’t believe that modern kitchens should ever get the short end of the stick. So, we rummaged through all our modular kitchen design images on the </span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:hsl(0, 75%, 60%);\">Corecare Portal</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\"> to select the cream of the lot for you — a collection that will make you want to redo your cook-space. Take a look at these 15 beautiful kitchen&nbsp;interior design ideas (for small Indian homes too!), and turn it into everyone’s favourate meet-up point.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">1. Add a pop of colour &amp; accessorise</span></h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/29154133/beige-color-modular-kitchen-with-tiled-wall-and-cabinets-dhaval-patel-2-e1528272192698-768x519.jpeg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Don’t you just love how this gorgeous blue peninsula brings in a burst of colour to this elegant single wall kitchen in beige and white? Plus, that&nbsp;eye-catching geometric pendant lamp further accentuates the entire look. Add two bar stools and you’ve got yourself a fantastic breakfast counter inside your kitchen!</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">2. Open it up &amp; make it inviting</span></h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/29154116/U-Shaped-Kitchen-With-Dark-Walnut-Wooden-Cabinets-prashant-chauhan-768x513.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Nailing that modern layout-meets-traditional accessories look, this semi-open kitchen stays connected with the rest of the home, thanks to partition shelves on the left, and two window-like arched openings straight ahead. The wooden cabinetry, white G4 stone countertop and earthy yellow backsplash make this Indian kitchen design a warm and inviting one — perfect if you’re a family that loves to gather in this area!</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">3. Go sophisticated with grey</span></h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/29154128/grey-shade-kitchen-cabinets-furdo-533x800.jpeg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Who says grey is dull and boring? This all-grey model kitchen with double-stacked cabinets is all about understated luxury. The black countertop breaks the flow and the raised panel cabinetry adds to the grandeur. We’re imagining potted herbs and a teal floor rug to bring out that grey even more! What do you think?</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">4. Adopt farmhouse chic</span></h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/29154122/luxurious-kitchen-with-white-cabinets-and-white-intricate-patterned-floor-shreya-bhimani-768x576.jpeg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Beautiful kitchens look like this! If you’re a fan of the American farmhouse kitchen style, here’s inspiration right from an Indian apartment. Powder blue base cabinets and a vintage crockery display unit on the right are so on-point, that even the modern handle-less wall cabinets and the sleek grey appliances don’t take away from them. And hey, don’t miss that stunning blue patterned backsplash and grey antique tile flooring. So much character!</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">5. Ace that white</span></h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/29154114/White-Themed-Modular-Kitchen-revathi-shailja-768x515.jpeg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Want to make your all-white kitchen come alive? A glazed light blue backsplash and eye-catching wall art work like magic in this new model&nbsp;kitchen. Semi-open and with a neat little island, we also like how it makes space for a compact dining set-up at its one end, therefore, partitioning the dining and kitchen space from the rest of this modern Indian apartment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:hsl(271, 100%, 50%);\">So, those are our Indian kitchen design ideas for you!

        "body": "<blockquote><p>Confused between wanting to play it safe with white and going bolder with color? In this post, we show you options for exterior house colors that combine well with white and also help you step out of our comfort zone.</p></blockquote><p>White is a colour that will never go out of style. No wonder then that we love it for our homes here in India.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what if we tell you that you can keep the white and yet give your house a much-needed upgrade?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, in this post, we help you choose exterior paint colours that look great with white, perk up your home, and yet suit Indian sensibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Just White</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/29092606/Modern-style-home_namrata-jain-1280x852.jpeg\"></figure><p>Let’s start with white itself. Not only is it a safe colour, but it also leaves a good first impression. Plus, whatever the style of your home, white will definitely work on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But you need to remember that white too has various shades and tones, and it’s important that you don’t settle for a stark white. Depending on your preference, go for cooler or warmer tones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The best part about working with white is that the details on your house stand out against it — just like the name of the house and the window frames do in the above picture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. White + Cream</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/29092610/shutterstock_269469479.jpg\"></figure><p>Change things just a little? Move a little away from a plain white look?</p><p>Bring in some off-white or cream!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on the light falling on it, your house will take on a clean look in the daylight, and when the evening light sets in, it will look warm and inviting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. White + Sand Brown + Maroon</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/29092608/shalini-pereira_tfod-1.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">This is an elegant combination and one that will help your home blend in with its surroundings. While white works as the major player here, the sand brown is the highlight (especially with that lovely wood-like texture), while the maroon is infused in subtle doses around the window.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">4. White + Dark Brown</span></h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/29092612/sunil-patil-associates_tfod.jpeg\"></figure><p>As you may have seen, it’s a great idea to go in for a white/off-white/cream coloured house in India, and then use a secondary colour to highlight a larger architectural detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this house too, the protruding portion of the house — which is anyway a design detail — has been further highlighted with a dark brown shade of exterior paint. It gives the house character and a modern appearance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>5. White + Warm Shades of Yellow</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/29092625/dnyanesh-madgavkar_tfod-11.jpg\"></figure><p>This is a happy combination of colours and a mutually beneficial one. White provides shades like mustard, amber or ochre the canvas to pop and to enjoy their spotlight, while the yellows give white a much-needed uplift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In an Indian set-up, they come together beautifully to give the house a warm and welcoming vibe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:hsl(210,75%,60%);\"><strong>So, these are ways for you to bring in a splash of color to the exteriors of your home and yet keep it elegant with white playing the major role.</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:hsl(210,75%,60%);\"><strong>Got any color combinations that you like? Let us know!</strong></span></p>",

Defective Power Supply</strong></h2><figure class=\"image image-style-side\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/08142011/IMG_20210408_140524-512x315.jpg\"></figure><p>Check your AC’s power point or stabilizer and check if it’s giving AC 220 volt output to the AC. This is an indication of a defective power supply or a faulty stabilizer. A loose connection, burnt power board, tripped MCB or an internal defect in the circuit can all lead to a faulty voltage supply to the AC, causing it to not turn on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Book an expert electrician from Corecare Company who will inspect the problem with your power supply or voltage output and resolve the problem for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2. Broken PCB or LVT Circuit</strong></h2><p>Check the display of your AC. Is it not turning on even after pressing the power button on the display panel or on the remote? This is an indication of a broken PCB or LVT circuit which causes a hindrance in turning your AC on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Book an expert AC technician who will figure out if the PCB board needs replacement or repair to resolve this issue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3. Problem with the Motor Van</strong></h2><figure class=\"image image-style-side\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/08143624/display1-512x292.jpg\"></figure><p>Lastly, check if there’s any error code flashing on the display.

It becomes very difficult to get by the harsh summer months without an AC. As a result, more and more people are installing air conditioning units in their homes. But does everyone know how an air conditioning system exactly works? Perhaps not. Take a look at this article to find out about various AC parts and how air conditioning works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>7 Major AC Parts and Their Functions</h2><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Let us take a look at the major components of your air conditioning system which keeps it running.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Components of an air conditioning system</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Compressor</strong>: The air conditioner compressor is the heart of your air conditioner unit. The air conditioner compressor turns gas into liquid. AC compressor functions by converting a gaseous low-pressure refrigerant from the evaporator into a high pressure and high temperature gas before entering the condenser. This process enables the air conditioner to cool down the warm air thereby cooling your room.</li><li><strong>Condenser coil: </strong>The condenser coil is attached to a fan. This fan cools down the gas which comes in at high pressure, thereby converting it into a liquid form as mentioned above. The condenser coil is fit on the outside of the air conditioning unit and is one of the most crucial components of the air conditioning system.</li><li><strong>Evaporator: </strong>The liquid that leaves the condenser coil next travels to the evaporator through very small pipes. The pressure is very low inside the evaporator and this converts the liquid to a gaseous state. The gas by now cools down and passes on to the next part of the air conditioning unit.</li><li><strong>Blowing unit and air handler:</strong> The blowing unit and the air handler work in a cycle to pull in the warm air into the air conditioning unit and pass out the cool air back into the room. These two units are responsible for the equal distribution of cold air throughout the room.</li><li><strong>Thermostat: </strong>The thermostat helps the air conditioning system to maintain the correct temperature. Unless the AC is at the right temperature inside, the various air conditioning parts won’t function properly. If your <a href=\"http://www.urbancompany.com/blog/home/ac-not-cooling-here-is-why/\">AC is not cooling your house</a> it’s most likely due to a&nbsp; damaged thermostat.&nbsp;The thermostat therefore is very important and controls the temperature of the AC.</li><li><strong>Filters:</strong> Every air conditioning unit comes with a filter. The&nbsp; AC filter keeps the dust and the dirt of the air from getting into the main unit of the AC.

Get your AC serviced and cleaned regularly to keep the various AC parts in proper working order. An air conditioner is a type of machine which relies on all its parts to work together. The compressor is dependent on the condenser coil which in turn highly depends on the evaporator and the process continues. So, all the parts of the air condition should remain in a good shape at all times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">While it’s easy to clean and maintain certain components of the air conditioning unit such as the filters and the drain pipes on your own, it’s difficult to fix other parts. A broken air conditioner compressor might not be easy to repair on your own. When faced with such situations it is better to book </span><a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/hyderabad-samsung-ac-service/\">AC repair service</a><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\"> from Corecare to get your machine checked.

However, an AC can only work optimally only if you take proper care of it. A dirty AC can lead to various infections and diseases. Which is why, air conditioner cleaning and servicing is important both before and after the the AC season. But what happens if we don’t get it serviced regularly? One of the most common problem people face is that their AC starts smelling foul. This happens mostly due to mould and bacterial growth in the AC air ducts. So, if your AC is stinking, get an AC duct cleaning done. But first, what causes this foul smell? Let’s find out.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/03163243/shutterstock_402961492-768x512.jpg\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/03163243/shutterstock_402961492-768x512.jpg</span></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Top 3 Reasons Why Your AC is Stinking</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. When your AC smells of DIRTY SOCKS</strong></p><p><br>The first reason why your AC is blowing smelly air is due to a build-up of mould (a type of fungi) and bacteria inside the AC duct. Disease causing bacteria and moulds are harmful for human health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All air conditioners work by converting hot air into cold air. This process leads to condensation and formation of little droplets of water inside the AC unit. These droplets of water should drain out via the AC duct, but at times the moisture and leftover water causes fungus and bacteria to grow inside the AC ducts. This causes a foul mouldy stink in your AC which is similar to the smell of dirty, old socks. A stinking AC calls for air conditioner cleaning and maintenance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Pro tip:</i>&nbsp;You will&nbsp; notice some greenish-black accumulation on the pipes and the ducts if there is a mould infestation.&nbsp;To prevent this get AC duct cleaning done regularly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;When your AC smells of ROTTEN EGGS</strong></p><p><br>If your room smells of rotten eggs when you turn on the AC, it is most likely due to a dead insect or an animal stuck somewhere inside the AC. Insects, rats, and even birds often get inside the dark chambers of air conditioners. failing to get out, they die and begin to decompose inside. This causes a terribly foul smell, which makes it difficult to stay in the room. If you notice this smell, do not waste time and book an<a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/ahmedabad-lg-ac-service/\"> AC repair service </a>from Urban Company. A dead animal inside the AC can spread diseases. Get the animal removed and the air conditioner cleaned at the earliest. Have it thoroughly sterilised post that to prevent any germ build up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;When your AC smells MOULDY</strong></p><p><br>If you notice a foul, lingering and spongy smell every time you switch on your AC, there may be a problem with the drain duct. The drainage system in every air conditioner collects the condensed water droplets and filters them out of the machine. However, if the drain is clogged or the system malfunctions due to some reason, the water will not be drained out. It will accumulate in the drain pipe and become a breeding ground for all kinds of fungi, bacteria, mould and other germs. So, get an air conditioner cleaning done from time to time&nbsp;to ensure a proper functioning of your AC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How To Deal With A Stinking AC?</strong></h2><p>Taking care of your appliance is very important.&nbsp; The air conditioning system requires proper and regular cleaning, servicing and maintenance. With Corecare by your side, air conditioner cleaning, repair and maintenance is all the more easy. Regular cleaning and check-up of your AC will help you in avoiding sudden maintenance costs.

Seeking the help of trusted AC repair service seems like the best option in such situations. However, not all issues need professional help and can be resolved on our own. So, here’s a basic air conditioner troubleshooting guide to help you find out how to fix your AC.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Air Conditioner Troubleshooting: Top 10 AC Problems and Solutions</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Do you have a dirty AC filter?</strong>If you have a clogged and dirty AC filter, it could decrease the operational efficiency of the system and reduce its ability to cool the air. Clean the filter every month, especially if you have pets or if the AC unit is always on!</li><li><strong>Do you have other electrical devices located too close to the AC unit</strong>?If you have placed television, microwave or refrigerator close to your AC unit, it’s time to move them. These devices release a lot of hot air, making the room more hot than cool. As a result, when placed to next an AC, they impact the cooling efficiency of the air conditioner.</li><li><strong>Is your room properly sealed to keep the warm air out?</strong>Check if all the windows and doors are properly sealed to make sure warm air doesn’t enter from outside.</li><li><strong>Does your AC have incorrect thermostat settings?</strong><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Very often, thermostats don’t give the correct reading.

This usually happens when the thermostat:</span></li><li><strong>Is sunlight obstructing the normal working of your AC?</strong>If your AC is set against a sunny window, it might have to work very hard to cool your room. It is advisable to have light-blocking curtains and shades for the AC to be more efficient.</li><li><strong>Is there lack of ventilation for the AC compressor?</strong>The outdoor compressor has to have an adequate airflow inside and out. Ensure that there is nothing in front of the AC blocking airflow. Clear out plants, furniture or anything else that might be blocking inflow and outflow of air.</li><li><strong>Is air coming out of ceiling and floor registers?</strong>To address this issue, inspect if the fan of the evaporator is running and that the circuit breakers are in working condition. Also, do check for any wiring issues with the equipment.</li><li><strong>Has the circuit breaker tripped?</strong><br>If the circuit breaker is in tripped position, try to reset it with the reset button. If it does not work with one reset, try not to attempt the second reset immediately as it could harm the AC unit. Recurring tripping could indicate frequent voltage fluctuations or faulty wiring. Do not attempt solving this on your own, and <a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/delhi-ncr-ac-service-repair\">book an AC repair service</a> from Urban Company.</li><li><strong>The AC compressor starts but the fan does not.</strong>The issue might be with the motor of the condenser fan and not the compressor.

        "body": "<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Have you ever gone through the problem of your air conditioning unit blowing out hot air instead of cooling your room? This issue can get on our nerves especially during the hot summers. There are many reasons why your air conditioning system is not in its proper state. Read on to find out how to fix AC and the 6 common reasons why your AC is not cooling your room.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>6 Reasons why your AC is not cooling</strong></h2><p>Below are some of the major reasons why your Air conditioning unit is blowing hot air:</p><h3><strong>1. Dirty air filter</strong></h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/03165112/shutterstock_273894074.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">the most common reason why your split and window AC is not cooling is because of unclean air filters. If the AC filter is unclean or clogged with dust and dirt, it might result in various problems. It could interfere with the proper working of the thermostat. Dirt in the AC filters block the passage of cool and warm air&nbsp; inside the ducts. It could also make the evaporator coil freeze, thus blocking the passage of cool air from the outlet.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">&nbsp;It is advisable to get the</span><a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/bangalore-samsung-ac-service/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=acnotcooling&amp;utm_campaign=bloginline\"> AC filter checked </a><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">by Urban Company and change it to a new one, if clogge</span></p><h3><strong>2. Incorrect thermostat settings</strong></h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/03165112/shutterstock_519415378.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">You need to check the working of the AC thermostat if your split or window AC is not cooling. It is a problem if your air conditioner unit blows out cool air and then lukewarm air. When faced with such a situation, turn the thermostat settings to auto mode. This way the fan works only when the air is being cooled.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\"> Always keep the AC thermostat on “Auto” mode instead of “On” mode. This is a common reason why your AC is not cooling.</span></p><h3><strong>3. Dirty outside unit</strong></h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/03165111/shutterstock_639550594.jpg\"></figure><p>Reason why an unclean outside unit hampers the working of your AC, it is important&nbsp;you understand how air conditioning works.</p><p>1. <strong>The evaporator</strong> (inside unit)-absorbs heat from air around you and transfers it to the outside air conditioning unit.</p><p>2. <strong>Condenser</strong> (outside unit)- then condenses the hot air into cool air.</p><p>A clogged condenser will not allow a proper cooling of the air conditioning system. Debris and dirt will block even heat transfer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Wondering how to fix AC? Clean the condenser and give it ample room to breathe, by removing weed and dirt surrounding it. To avoid heavy <a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/bangalore-samsung-ac-service\">air conditioner maintenance</a> charges&nbsp;get your air conditioning unit repaired and maintained regularly from Corecare.</p><h3><strong>4. Faulty motors</strong></h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/03165111/shutterstock_701853208.jpg\"></figure><p>If the motor of the fan is either broken or faulty, the outdoor unit will be unable to dissipate heat, thus interfering with the cooling ability of an air conditioning unit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> This problem of your split or window AC not cooling is best handled only by a professional. You can hire professionals from Urban Company for the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);\">To keep you AC working properly all throughout it is advisable that you get your air conditioning unit serviced and maintained by an expert. Wondering how often should you have your air conditioner serviced? Get it done every 3 months to enhance the efficiency and output of your air conditioning unit. This is because an unmaintained AC system can shoot up your electricity bills, in addition to being ill-equipped in cooling your home. Therefore, do take adequate care of the system, to decrease the possibility of expensive air conditioner maintenance charges and repairs.

        "body": "<p>The primary function of a refrigerator is to ensure food does not go bad, but very often the appliance is too unhygienic to follow through on this promise. Stains left on the shelves by milk cartons, sauces and jam containers slowly develop into a breeding ground for fungi. Which is why, knowing some refrigerator cleaning hacks is extremely important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this post, we tell you:<br>• Tips to clean your refrigerator<br>• Ways to ensure your refrigerator stays clean</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tips to clean your refrigerator</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Empty the fridge</strong><br>The first step to a clean fridge is emptying it. Switch off the fridge, take out all the food items stored in it. If there is food stored in freezer, place them in an icebox or a big vessel and surround with ice packs. Cover your counter top (where you will keep all the refrigerated food items) with plastic table mats or kitchen towels. This will prevent your counter tops from getting stained or wet (from condensation).</li><li><strong>Soak the trays and baskets</strong><br>Before you set off with cleaning supplies, soak the trays and baskets in hot water. Keep them soaked for 10 mins to soften grime and gravy stains.</li><li><strong>Get cleaning</strong><br>You can use cleaning fluids available in the market or make one at home using vinegar and warm water. Take out the trays from the water and using a sponge, clean the stains. For tricky areas, such as the rims or edges, you can also use a tooth brush to help clean up faster.</li><li><strong>Use cloth to dry the shelves</strong><br>Instead of paper or kitchen towels, use micro fiber cloths. Once you have washed the trays, use these cloths to dry them up.</li><li><strong>Clean the refrigerator</strong><br>When cleaning the refrigerator, start with the area adjacent to vents, then bottle racks, butter trays and the mini vanity box. You can use the cleaning fluid used earlier, or make one at home. In the case of the latter, mix vinegar and hot water in a bowl. Dip the micro fiber cloth and clean the refrigerator. Using a dry cloth, wipe the fridge dry. For the exteriors, repeat the process.</li><li><strong>Re-place the trays and baskets</strong><br>Now that the whole refrigerator is clean, it’s time put all the trays and food items back in. When you are done, leave the fridge door open for some time to dry the inside.</li></ol><h2>Ways to ensure your refrigerator stays clean</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once the trays and baskets are in place, here is what you need to do:</p><p>1. Put plastic mats or kitchen towels on top of the trays and underneath the crisper box. You can also use plastic wraps and even cling films. Remember to put kitchen towels at the bottom of the crisper. This will ensure that any juice from the vegetables or fruits will not make the bottom very dirty. Replace this paper every week for best results.</p><p>2. Wipe off the water droplets from the containers before you put them back. This prevents any mess and the bottles will not slip from your kid’s hands.</p><p>3. Move all leftovers to glass containers. This will ensure you see them and eat them instead of forgetting them inside for weeks. You can also use stickers or post-its to mark the things separately.</p><p>4. If you are a stickler for keeping similar things together, then buy some trays or bins where you can put such things together. This is especially true for the freezer as ice on the meat and fish packets make it difficult to pull them out. Keeping them in separate boxes will make it easier to take them out, especially if you have a non frost-free refrigerator.</p><p>5. Keep a container of activated carbon at the back of the bottom shelf. This will deodorize the fridge better. If you do not have activated carbon at home, then keep a bowl of baking soda or cut a lemon in half and keep it inside for 2-3 days before replacing it with another one. If you like the smell of coffee, you can also keep a few coffee beans in a small bowl to keep the fridge smelling good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">And there you have it!

        "body": "<p>The importance of adequate security measures for homes and business spaces cannot be stressed enough. Many shops, commercial spaces, educational institutions, and public areas are now under the watchful eyes of surveillance systems. The recordings can be used to monitor and thwart crime. CCTV footages can also be produced as evidence in the court of law. The advancement in technology has also enabled sophisticated night vision cameras to capture every movement outside your house at night. This way you can be sure about the safety of you and your loved ones. With a sharp increase in setting up of CCTV cameras for commercial surveillance, the prices of CCTV systems have recorded a drastic decline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are various affordable CCTV cameras for home available in the market. The costs of CCTV cameras and CCTV installation charges depend on various factors, including image resolution, area to be monitored, data storage options, the complexity of the networking, etc. Most of the vendors of surveillance systems themselves also offer CCTV installation services. If you have bought CCTV cameras online and are not very sure about how to go about CCTV installation procedure, we, at UrbanClap, offer you the best-in-class CCTV camera installation services at affordable prices, so that you can be rest assured about the safety of your home and your loved ones. If you are unsure about whether it is a good idea to opt for security camera systems or not, we tell you why such an investment is a necessity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read on to find out the five major advantages of CCTV cameras mentioned in this article</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Deters thieves and robbers</strong></p><p>The presence of surveillance cameras and a warning board, stating that the area is under surveillance, can act as a strong deterrent to criminals and thieves, as it is possible to identify people and track their movements, using the recorded footages. In commercial establishments, if there are trained personnel who continuously monitor these footages, it is also possible to track suspicious activities and the possibility of shoplifting by petty thieves, and prevent untoward incidents, before they actually occur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. To record evidence</strong></p><p>In case a theft or any crime does occur, the recordings of a CCTV can be utilized by the police to analyze the incident and produce the footage as an evidence against the criminals, in the court of law. Modern-day monitoring systems can record audio as well. These footages could come in particularly handy, to gather evidence about the entry and exit time of people or if you want to replay a series of events that have actually transpired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Monitor suspicious activities</strong></p><p>By discreetly mounting secret surveillance cameras, you can collect information about suspicious activities, such as theft of valuables by employees and mistrustful movements of miscreants. As modern cameras are small enough to be concealed, you can collect enough evidence and catch them red-handed, without having to alert them about the presence of a camera.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Keep a tab on activities</strong></p><p>When does your maid come to work and when does she leave? How well does your nanny take care of the baby? Are you doubtful that an employee is faking his/her work hours? You can keep a tab on all of these and much more, by installing security cameras at strategic locations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Maintain adequate records</strong></p><p>By continuously transmitting the recorded footages on to a central database, you can use both wired and wireless CCTV systems to your advantage. If you want to review something that happened a week or a fortnight ago, you can watch them at your convenience and make informed decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With these advantages, you can ensure safety for yourself, your loved ones, and your valuables. However, miscreants might find a way about these systems too, by blocking the view of the camera or by keeping their face hidden. Hence we suggest that if there are other cameras around, the police can pick up similar details from another angle, to try and crack the details about crimes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We hope with these points in mind, you will definitely secure your home with CCTV cameras. After all “Safety first is safety always!”</p>",

        "body": "<p>If there is something which creeps out every single person, it is pest infestation! Unclean spaces can result in disease-ridden pests all around your house. It is mostly around the monsoon that the moisture-laden air and rain result in damp walls, which leads to an influx of pests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody can bear the sight of crawling insects in their kitchen. Wandering about, taking a walk on your dirty dishes in the basin, around the kitchen cabinets, feeding on bits of spilled food, waiting for you to go while peeping from holes in the walls… all this can leave you feeling disgusted. Also, there are hygiene and disease-related issues. These intruders leave bacteria behind all around your house, which can make you ill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now it becomes tough to decide how to pull out the bugs and clean those rugs. These tiny little insects crawling through minute cracks definitely have the ability to make your home unhealthy. Aim to keep your surroundings clean and the kitchen cleaner. Cleaning is also a spiritual habit. How? If considered the first ritual in the morning, it results in a feeling of accomplishment, driving you through the day with zeal to finish your job perfectly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can avoid infestations by adopting a kitchen cleaning routine on a daily basis. Some tasks to be done every night and day include dumping waste, wiping the kitchen floor, keeping your stove spotless, and so on. The kitchen is the heart of the house. It should be cleaned at all times to be disease free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the biggest challenges is that pest-infestation is uncontrollable if not treated properly and in time. UrbanClap is connected with the best pest control agencies that will help you get you rid of the problem, without harming you and your family in any way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once cleaned thoroughly, it is also important to maintain the hygiene of the house. The kitchen is the place where you cook all those yummy delicacies… it should not be a guesthouse for ants, cockroaches and lizards. There are a few ways to save your personal space and prevent pests from attacking your kitchen again after pest control…</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Keep your kitchen dry</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03170036/shutterstock_510919243-768x740.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Dying insects always run towards water. Water or any other liquid such as oil, when mixed together, create a greasy compound that invites pests and also permanently discolours your cabinets. So always keep your kitchen dry, especially the basin… aim to wipe it every time you use water.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Keep food in airtight containers</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03170034/shutterstock_597179033-768x512.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Keep the food resources locked in airtight containers and avoid eating food anywhere other than the kitchen and dining area. In this way, you avoid sprinkling food particles around, which can otherwise become the perfect living resource for these insects.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Clean the kitchen cabinets</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03170033/shutterstock_492388048-768x512.jpg\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">The kitchen is the most planned out area of the house today. It is, in fact, a well-designed workstation that is efficiently functional at all times. The cabinets of the kitchen organize the space for us, allowing us to complete our tasks easily. Cleaning the kitchen cabinets is just as important, whether it is dusting them daily or wiping the splatters every once in a while. It helps maintain the beauty of the kitchen and also keeps the kitchen pest free.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Dispose of waste on a regular basis</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03170031/shutterstock_503888032-768x512.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">It is advisable to dispose of waste from kitchen, on a daily basis. This will ensure that the house is cleaned regularly, and no pests can infest your home.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);\">No matter how hard we try keeping our kitchen clean, our busy life leaves us with very little time to do a deep cleaning. In such cases, you can always call in the experts from Corecare who will deep clean your kitchen and make it sparkle!</span></p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);\">It is not an easy job to get rid of these intruders as they have the ability to survive the worst. Some insects are said to be able to endure even nuclear blasts. However, if you still find these creatures crawling around your floor after pest control, spray the poisonous chemical left behind by the pest- control company. It has the ability to work magic and get your kitchen pest free.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);\">With these simple yet effective methods, you can ensure a pest free kitchen that you can be proud of!</span></p>",

        "body": "<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">From black and white TVs to CRTs to LEDs and LCDs, buying a TV these days involves a lot of research. To save you the trouble of an extensive search, here is our&nbsp; TV&nbsp;buying guide. We have compiled a list of different TVs and their advantages to help you choose the best TV for you and your family.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. LCD Televisions</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03165644/shutterstock_408270880-2-768x522.jpg\"></figure><p>LCD stands for Liquid Crystal Display and these LCD TVs have replaced the CRT (Cathode Ray Tubes) TVs in the 21st century. This technology was used in the eighties in portable computers as Passive matrix LCDs but was too slow for television usage. After much experimentation, by 2008, the LCD TVs managed to conquer the market-beating all the expensive as well as the budget friendly range</p><p>.</p><p>LCD panels need external light, so a backlight is used to produce visibility. These backlights are Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps, commonly known as CCFLs, which have a diffuser to spread white light evenly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LCD TVs are not able to capture the black color perfectly and is difficult to see quick movements on the screen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. LED Televisions</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03165639/shutterstock_655200394-768x508.jpg\"></figure><p>LED stands for Light Emitting Diodes and LED TVs are basically LCD panels backlit by LEDs instead of CCFLs. These LCDs are either lit by white LED displays or Red, Green and Blue (RGB) displays.</p><p>There are many advantages of LED displays over LCDs:</p><ul><li>LEDs have a better colour arrangement.</li><li>LED TVs are slim and are much lighter.</li><li>Since these TVs consume less power, they remain cool and there are fewer chances of overheating, thereby, increasing the lifespan of your TV.</li></ul><p>There are quite a few variations as well as developments on the LED television sets, like the OLED and QLED television sets.</p><ul><li>OLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diodes and in OLED TVs, an organic semiconductor produces light in response to an electric current. Currently, only high-end models of LG and some other manufacturers are using OLED technology. OLED has higher contrast ratios and are available in the 4K format as well. They do not suffer from bad viewing angles in their picture quality. Brightness remains consistent in these TV sets.</li><li>QLEDs use quantum dot technology and nanocrystals are put in front of LEDs and are able to produce much higher resolution.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Flat Screen TVs</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03165634/shutterstock_196741052-768x498.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Usually, LED and LCD television sets are flat screen TVs. They provide standard reflections and the sides get darkened when viewed from close. They are not that cumbersome in their size and are easier to handle. Flat screen TVs come in all price ranges.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Curved Screen TVs</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03165633/shutterstock_535083832-768x468.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">While curved screen TVs are bulky, there are certain individual characteristics that make it ideal at times. Many tend to believe that curved screen TVs provide a more realistic experience than flat screens as their viewing angle is wide. They can be viewed from close and there will be less darkening. Curved Screen TVs are expensive. LG makes curved OLED television sets.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. 3D TVs</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/03165632/shutterstock_147901298-768x448.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">3D television sets offer depth perception and a much immersive experience through stereoscopic displays, multi-view displays, etc. Some display two different images simultaneously and special 3D glasses must be used for getting the perfect vision. Some 3D TV sets are autostereoscopic that do not require 3D glasses. 3D TV sets are rare, except Sony and LG that have a range of 3D TVs while other manufacturers have discontinued them.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);\">At Corecare, we provide you with professionals who have in-depth knowledge and can guide you in purchasing and </span><a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/hyderabad-tv-repair/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=differenttypesoftv&amp;utm_campaign=bloginline\"><span style=\"color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);\">installing your new Television set</span></a><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);\">.

        "body": "<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Most of us rely on our washing machines to do the tedious task of washing our clothes. From regular wear like t-shirts, tops and pants to heavier clothes like towers, bed sheets and curtains, these machines have made our lives easier and better. It makes sense, therefore, to keep these machines running in good condition.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regular washing machine maintenance goes a long way in helping these machines last for years to come. The truth is, you or your family can do most of these things right at your home.</p><h2>10 Washing Machine Maintenance Tips</h2><p>Here are a few washing machine maintenance tips that will help you to take care of your appliance better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong># 1. Deep Cleaning</strong></p><p>People expect their washing machines to give 100% every time. However, this is not always the case. Washing machines problems occur and the appliances start to lose their efficiency after a point of time. You may notice that your clothes are not coming out as clean as they used to when the machine was new. The main reason behind this is the scaling that occurs due to the micro-residuals present in the water. This can be a big issue in areas that have hard water.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In such a scenario, you should deep clean your machine a bit more. Use a strong machine cleaner that is able to remove all the scaling without damaging the metal and plastic parts of the appliance. This does not necessarily mean you have to buy the most expensive machine cleaner in the market but also buying the cheapest one is not advisable.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/13191209/shutterstock_10303190201.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>#2. Clean the Rubber Gasket</strong></p><p>This is an important part of your machine that suffers a lot of wear and tear. The rubber gasket wraps the edges of the washer-dryer and protects your clothes from damage and your hands from any sharp edges. Be it a front load or a top load machine, some amount of micro dust particles enter it every time you open the door. These dust particles usually gather on the edges and sides of the gasket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The detergent and softener particles also leave residues on the gasket. Being located outside the tub, it suffers from regular spills but remains unclean as we tend to ignore it completely. This is another reason you should regularly clean the rubber gasket with a damp cloth. Doing it once a week should suffice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>#3. Protect the Finish</strong></p><p>New looking and clean home appliances enhance the appearance of your place. However, an old washing machine usually does not look good and may even impair the look of the room or the house. Some people ignore this aspect and do not care to clean the outside or top of the machine. Front load washing machines are the ones that suffer the most from this. Their plain top surface makes them a magnet for assorted stuff that keeps gathering on them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People forget that despite being bulky pieces of equipment, washing machines are delicate and require proper care, both in terms of their working abilities and looks. The tricks to keep the machine looking new are simple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Clean the top and sides of your machine with a glass cleaner so that it does not damage the finish. Maintaining the pre-installed factory finish is the best way you can keep your machine look bright for long. Also, keep machine covered when not in use and do not put any heavy stuff on top. This will prevent scratches from developing.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/13191208/shutterstock_522530710.jpg\"></figure><p><strong>#4. Protect from Spillage</strong></p><p>Washing machines also gather residues from detergent spillage. Despite your efforts to use the best detergents or softeners in the market, their residue becomes sticky over time and start to smell bad. The best way to clean this sticky residue is to wipe it with a mild dishwashing cleaner. Also, do not forget to clean the inside of the drum with a damp cloth as it also builds lint, detergent and dirt residue over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>#5. Leave the Door Open</strong></p><p>Do not close the door of your washing machine immediately after using it. This is one of the biggest blunders that most people make while using the machine. They think keeping the door open will build dirt and dust inside the machine. This is true to some extent but this does not mean that you have to close it immediately. Leaving the door open for 15 to 30 minutes removes the moisture and prevents mould and bacteria build up in your machine. This also properly dries up the tub and protects delicate parts from damage caused by the moisture. A good way to ensure the inside has no moisture is to wipe it off with a thick dry towel 15-30 minutes after the washing has ended and the leftover moisture has dried somewhat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/13191211/shutterstock_301575743.jpg\"></figure>",

        "body": "<p>You think you have all the information you need for buying a washing machine. Some of that information would be based on your own experience, say, of using an LG or a Samsung washing machine. A spattering of friends, colleagues and even your usual repair guy would have shared their opinions on which is the best washing machine brand in India. Some might even have shared a rough price list.</p><p>Armed and ready, you walk into the store thinking this should be an easy task, but soon, you are baffled all the choices available! You ask yourself again:</p><ul><li>What is the best washing machine to buy?</li><li>Which brand has the best fully automatic washing machine?</li><li>Should I buy the washing machine online instead?</li><li>What machine uses the least amount of water?</li></ul><p>It’s always good to do a thorough research on your own before you make a decision. Here are 5 important questions that can help you make the right choice when buying a washing machine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1. What Type of Washing Machine Do You Want?</h2><ul><li>semi-automatic</li><li>fully-automatic</li></ul><p><strong>Fully-Automatic:</strong> Most people prefer to own a <a href=\"http://www.urbancompany.com/blog/home/top-10-brands-of-washing-machines-in-india-that-you-can-buy-in-2018/\">fully automatic washing machine</a> since there is no need to check the machine during the cycle. All you need to do is load the detergent compartment, switch on the machine and you’re done. The clothes only need to be put out to air dry.</p><p>Fully automatic machines are further divided into two types:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.urbancompany.com/blog/home/best-top-load-washing-machine-in-india/\">Front loading washing machines</a></li><li>Top loading washing machines</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/10161855/post-14-1-480x480.png\"></figure><p><strong>Semi – Automatic:</strong> A <a href=\"http://www.urbancompany.com/blog/home/top-10-brands-of-washing-machines-in-india-that-you-can-buy-in-2018/\">semi-automatic washing machine</a>, on the other hand, has two tubs and the clothes need to be manually transferred from the wash tub to the spin/dryer tub. It may seem tiring to operate but the savings in purchase price, electricity usage and water consumption are significant.</p><p>You can easily compare washing machines and find which one suits your needs best.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. What are the must-have features of the best washing machine?</h2><p>One of the most important washing machine features is the wash settings available. Some important ones that you must have in your washing machine are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wash Cycles:</strong> Most new age washing machines come with a gentle/delicate wash cycle meant for underwear or delicate fabrics. There are also pre-programmed wash cycles for heavy fabrics such as denim, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spin Cycle:</strong> In washing machines, a spin cycle is measured in rotations per minute (rpm). Higher the rpm, the better it will dry your clothes. In certain models, you can set these manually while in others the machine decides which spin cycle to run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:hsl(0, 75%, 60%);\"><i>Did you know! Using too much detergent can harm your washing machine. Read more about </i></span><a href=\"http://www.urbancompany.com/blog/home/appliance-repair/7-mistakes-to-avoid-while-using-your-washing-machine/\"><span style=\"color:hsl(0, 75%, 60%);\"><i>7 mistakes to avoid while using washing machines.</i></span><i>&nbsp;</i></a></p><hr><p><strong>Fuzzy Logic:</strong> Technology has advanced so much that the washing machines these days are intelligent. Based on the weight of the clothes, it knows how much water or detergent to use and how much time to take to wash your clothes. This will save you from wasting your time in figuring out the settings for each load of laundry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pre-soak:</strong> Some washing machines allow you to soak your clothes for a specific duration of time before the wash cycle begins. You can use this feature to wash a really dirty load.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Temperature Control:</strong> Few of the latest models, especially front load washing machines, come with temperature control. This gives you the opportunity to wash clothes in warm water or hot water based on your needs. While this can help kill the bacteria and also clean the clothes well, use this feature only when it is necessary since a lot of energy is consumed in heating water in the washing machine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. What is the Capacity and Material of the Wash Tub?</h2><p><strong>Capacity: </strong>If you like to do small loads of laundry every day, it is better to invest in a washing machine that has a relatively small wash tub. However, if you run large loads of laundry then you need to find a model that has a wash tub with a good capacity. There must be enough space for the clothes to move during the wash cycle. If you intend to wash curtains, bed covers, etc. in the washing machine then you need one with a larger capacity wash tub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> The material also matters since it plays an important role in the upfront cost and longevity of the appliance. Porcelain enamel, toughened plastic and stainless steel are three most popular materials used. If you compare washing machine prices based on the type of material used for the tub, you will find that stainless steel tubs cost more. However, they are corrosion-resistant and last a long time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Have You Read Enough Washing Machine Reviews?</h2><p>Once you know that important features you want in your washing machine, it becomes easier to make your purchase decision. Since there are so many brands and washing machine models on the market, it will be helpful to check out the customer reviews to compare the models. Reading these reviews will also help you understand the pros and cons of different washing machines better since these reviews are based on personal experiences of customers.</p><p>Now that you know what to look for in a washing machine, you can confidently make the right choice.</p>",

        "body": "<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">A water heater or a geyser, as it is more commonly known in India, needs as much care (if not more) as any other electronic device. Though manufacturers provide the best parts that can deal with the constant heating and cooling, you have to remember that even the best parts will wear down if put under continuous pressure. In this post, we will look at some tips for water heater maintenance and installation to prolong its life despite the regular expansion and contraction from heating and cooling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Points to keep in mind while installing a water heater or geyser</span></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">1. Space around the geyser:</span></h3><p>When you are installing a water heater, remember to keep some space between the apparatus and the walls. If the technician does not have enough wriggle room to check out the water heater parts, they will not be able to service it or repair it properly. <a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/chennai-geyser-reapir/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=waterheatermaintenance&amp;utm_campaign=bloginline\">Hire expert technicians from Corecare</a> to get the installation properly.</p><p>Also, it should be easily accessible if you want to repair it or get it serviced. Though some people put the geyser right on top of the toilet to supposedly get better access, this actually hinders the technician from reaching the apparatus easily. It is much better to put it on a portion of the wall that has nothing below the geyser and is away from damp areas like the shower, bathtub or toilet. This way, you or anyone can easily access it with a small stool.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Put the water heater at a sufficient height:</h3><p>Experts suggest that you should install the geyser at a height of at least 1.8 metres or 6 feet from the floor. This ensures that the water pressure is sufficient and you get a strong hot water flow in your tap rather than a trickle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Electrical connections and switches:</h3><p>Ensure that the geyser is connected to a Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB) that cuts off electricity in case of power fluctuations. This will minimise chances of any short circuit in the water heater. Also, keep the switch at a sufficient height away from small children but not too high that you or any adult has problems while trying to reach it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Do not keep the geyser switched on for extended periods</h3><p>People usually prefer to keep the geyser switched on for extended periods, especially<br>during the morning. &nbsp;The general notion is that since everyone needs warm water before they rush for work or school, keeping the geyser on will save time. That may have been the case once upon a time but today’s geysers heat the water within 5 minutes. As keeping the geyser on for extended periods will reduce the life of the apparatus, it makes better sense to put it on only 5 minutes before you need it and not half an hour before. Regular water heater maintenance can help in extending the life of your heater. You can also get your <a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/delhi-ncr-geyser-reapir/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=waterheatermaintenance&amp;utm_campaign=bloginline\">water heater repaired by Corecare service experts</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Save more electricity by lowering the temperature</h3><p>Water heater maintenance is important as you will save electricity as well!&nbsp; If you use a lower temperature setting as the water will reach that temperature faster. The reduced temperature means the geyser will have to work less and this will increase its life. Moreover, having warm water rather than very hot water in the tap will reduce chances of any accidental burns. Lowering the thermostat is especially important for families with small children.Hot water heater maintenance is hence very crucial to ensure you never run out of hot water during winters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>6. Check the anode rod inside the tank before winter</h3><p>Larger geysers have an anti-corrosion anode rod inside the tank. This rod attracts rust and other impurities present in the water, thereby preventing the tank from getting rusted or corroded. However, because of this, it itself corrodes away every few years.</p><p>Experts suggest that you check the anode rod every 3 years to see if the outer layer of magnesium has corroded away and 6 inches or more of the inner steel core is visible. If that is the case, then the rod needs to be replaced. The rod also has to be replaced if it is coated with whitish calcium sediments (happens when the water is hard) or its thickness has reduced considerably to below half an inch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>7. Check the pressure release valve</h3><p>Check at least once a year if the temperature and pressure release valves are working. You can check this by releasing the pressure a couple of times. It is a major issue if the relief valve at the water heater is leaking. You just need to drain some water out of your water geyser and remove the discharge tube. Thereafter replace the valve and it’s done!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>8. Keep an eye on the plug</h3><p>Power fluctuations and using low capacity wiring for the power socket means your switch will make a spark every now and then. You will also notice burn marks on your plug’s pins as the higher electricity wattage will heat up the plug and the pins and leave burn traces.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>In today’s time, one can’t imagine a life without appliances! They have become the most integral part of our day to day routine. Modern-day appliances are so highly efficient that they can perform the desired task in a very short duration of time, thereby reducing our workload and increasing our efficiency. But, the cyclic process of using them and not maintaining them well makes our appliances less efficient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, here we have listed down with some easy-to-do maintenance tips for your appliances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>5 easy tips to maintain your washing machine</strong></h1><h3>1. Everyday hack.</h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/03192739/shutterstock_585093076.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Most of the washing machines tend to retain a damp odor after you have washed your clothes. Over a period of time, accumulation of slime and grease makes the machine less efficient in washing very dirty clothes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the door of the washing machine open after you are done with your laundry. This process completely dries out the inner walls of the machine leaving it odor free.</li></ul><h3>2. Keep the interiors clean.</h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/03192739/shutterstock_142581478.jpg\"></figure><p>We tend to forget that our washing machine can only clean our clothes, it can’t clean itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, it’s very important to do a routine cleanup of our machine to increase its shelf life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Tip:</strong></li><li>Use a solution of hot water, vinegar and baking soda and let your machine complete a full cycle (without any clothes). This process rinses out the slime and grease our machine accumulates. Do this every 2-3 months.</li><li>You can also use a solution of Harpic (regular household toilet cleaner) and water to rinse out the accumulated grease and dirt. You can try this method every month.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>3.&nbsp;Overloading? Strict NO!</h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/03192739/shutterstock_609559592.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Overloading the washing machine suffocates it and none of the clothes get cleaned in the process. It also puts a lot of pressure on the motor and results in overheating which is again bad for the machine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Tip: </strong>Do your laundry in separate batches. Go for fewer clothes but lots of water (don’t go overboard though!). This makes your clothes cleaner than usual.</li></ul><h3><strong>&nbsp;4. Excessive Washing powder does more harm!</strong></h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://de927adv5b23k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/03192739/shutterstock_121188085.jpg\"></figure><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">We all have a common tendency to add heaps of washing powder to get cleaner and shinier clothes. Doing so not only results in damaging the internal pipes and the motor but also damages the texture of our clothes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Tip:</strong> Use suggested quantities of washing powder and always use the type of detergent recommended for your machine.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A lot has been said about the air we are breathing, specially in the capital. Post Diwali, Delhi wears a cloud of smoke that threatens to choke us. Schools were actually closed due to the fear of subjecting the children to this air.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">People may be aware of the pollutants outside, but how pure do you think is the air you are breathing in your homes? According to a research by the Environmental Protection Agency, we spend about 90% of our time indoors. Add to that, the indoor pollution is 10 times more than the pollution outside. Because we spend so much of our time indoors, these tricks can be quite helpful for breathing in clean air and keeping us safe. The branded air purifiers may be flooding the market and also see a surge in their sale right now, but they aren’t as economical as these hacks. If we may say, these hacks together can prove to be more efficient than any air purifier in the market.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">Check them out:</span></p><figure class=\"media\"><oembed url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avONvyBMsyI\"></oembed></figure><h2 style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;How to MAKE&nbsp;an air purifier</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(84,83,83);\">All you need is a HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter, an old table fan, a colorful sheet of paper and a cardboard. HEPA filters are easily available online and are extremely economical compared to a good air purifier. It is also much easier to clean and&nbsp;can be cleaned every two months. Use a dry cloth or a dry brush to do the same. If you clean them every month then a HEPA filter can last for more than two years! Compared to a store bought air purifier which needs a filter change every 6 months, this is a far economical choice. These filters have to meet the international standards of air purity and quality to qualify as a HEPA filter. The homemade purifier traps 99% of impurities and improves the air quality significantly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><h2 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Desk Plants</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now this comes directly recommended from NASA. Desk plants don’t occupy too much space and also spruce up the interiors. There are many plants that effectively clean the air inside the house. These are also easily available in any nursery and can be planted in creative planters, or better still – make your own planters ! Watch the video and learn all about them:</p><figure class=\"media\"><oembed url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yseaPpV6pHQ\"></oembed></figure><h2 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Cleaning the dust</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Part of the problem of severe bronchial diseases lies in the fact that we inhale a lot of dust. People who live close to traffic or places that have construction going on are at severe risk. Plants and HEPA filters (or ever air purifiers) can only work to a certain extent. Cleaning the dust with a vacuum cleaner or having a <a href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/delhi-ncr-professional-home-cleaning\">professional cleaning service from Corecare</a> can help manifolds.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">With these easy hacks you can keep the air around you pure and prevent the discomfort that your body is being subjected with the alarming levels of pollution to a large extent. We wish you a healthy living!</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p>",
